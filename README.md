Summary:
Analyzes the human CFTR gene, identifying a highly stable 552-amino acid protein essential for regulating salt and water balance in the body. Using bioinformatics tools,  it confirmed the protein’s primary location at the cell membrane, where it functions as a gated channel for chloride transport. Structurally, the protein relies on a specific transmembrane domain and an ATP-binding engine to move ions effectively. Evolutionary mapping shows this sequence is highly conserved across species, highlighting its critical role in preventing the thick mucus build-up seen in Cystic Fibrosis. Ultimately, the findings emphasize that the protein's precise folding and placement are vital for maintaining respiratory and digestive health.
